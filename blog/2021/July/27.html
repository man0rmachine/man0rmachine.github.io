                            So I got a kitten a couple of weeks ago and I wanted to show her off. She was a rescue kitten, and the second cat of the family. She's only 4 months old and loves to yell at everything.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            She's currently getting along quite well with the older cat June. They were introduced to each other the first day we got Sylvie and there was hardly any fighting or hiding at all. They even started playing with some of the same toys after only 2 days together. June is very much a cat mom and loves to baby the kitten so hopefully they will become great friends as they both age.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Unfortunately, she got pink-eye (apparently this is quite common in kittens) so she had to get the cone of shame.

                            She is currently recovering and continuing to squeak as loudly and often as possible.
                        </p>
